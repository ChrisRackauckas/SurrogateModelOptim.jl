########## TODO

##  Doc strings for all functions, add comments where appropriate

##  Remove minimum from output of infill objectives

##  Add tests for all functions where appropriate

##  Assert that inputs have correct dimensions

##  Examples for different optimisation cases

##  Check that the underscore has been used accordingly for internal functions

##  Add test for std needing more than 1 surrogate

##  Results printing

##  Call and continue optimisation with the results type.

##  Documentation with PlotlyJS web based plots for easy viewing of different options. 

##  Check that the header of each function fits the function call signature

##  Categorical optimisation

##  Add test for parallel and not parallel

##  Add contribution file


########## IMPROVEMENTS

##  Add issymmetric && Symmetric to speed up certain cases in ScatteredInterpolation

##  Options to solve ScatteredInterpolation linear eq system on gpu.

##  Use iterative solver on cpu with a much larger tolerance. Test if keeping 
    the optimum settings from the previous iteration and using them as a seed
    improve convergence speed for the iterative solver. 

##  Possibility to save entire optimisation state in an easy manner. 

##  Try optimizing widths by optimizing a subset before optimizing the entire range.

##  Implement RBFs with sparse support to increase speed of solving linear eq. system.
